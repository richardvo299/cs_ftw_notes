# Hello Humanity!

This is officially our very first day of CoderSchool and out first day of the journey to become a wizard, wait, i meant a Software Engineer.

## What have we learnt so far?
* The names of some classmates and their favorite shows
* How to set up the coding environment
* How a website works
* What the heck is Git and why is it scary

## Silly stuffs happened today:
* Tried installing Terminal :)
* Kept getting distracted by the logo of Github (Is that an arm or the tail of the cat?)

### Note to self and future self:
**You didn't come this far just to come this far**
